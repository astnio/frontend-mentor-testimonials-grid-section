## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot about using CSS grid in this project. I had tipped my toes in it a bit in my previous project, but I got more involved in this one. I feel as though I have a better grasp on setting up grid and placing items within it. There is still a lot to get used to and experiment with, but I feel much more confident in it now.

### Continued development

Despite having a deeper understanding of grid, I still lack an understanding of some more advanced and nuanced concepts related to it.
